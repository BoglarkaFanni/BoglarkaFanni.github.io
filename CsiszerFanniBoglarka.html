        <h2>Future Full-Stack Developer</h2>
          <p> 
            Hey, I'm Bogi from Hungary. I've just started to learn webdeveloping. 
            I find coding really interesting so far and I can't wait to become a professional developer to create
            beautiful websites and apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally my plan was to study economics with commerce and marketing competence and after 
            that working as a marketing manager. 
            But things have changed and during the semesters I realized that this is not my cup of tea.
            I searched for other opportunities and fortunately now I'm about to grow into a webdeveloper.
